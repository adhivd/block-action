# BlockAction - a distributed class action settlement system

To run, clone the project, run `bundle install`, and then `rails server`

The website is hosted live at [blockaction.herokuapp.com](http://blockaction.herokuapp.com/). To save on hosting costs, the website "goes to sleep" after a few hours if nobody as visited it, so expect a white screen for a few seconds.
